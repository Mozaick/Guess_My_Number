✻ So what is the DOM actually?
Well, DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is,
basically, a structured representation of HTML documents.
The DOM allows us to use JavaScript to access HTML elements
and styles in order to manipulate them.

✻ So we can say that DOM is basically a connection point
between HTML documents and JavaScript code.
Now, the DOM is automatically created
by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads.
And it's stored in a tree structure
In this tree, each HTML element is one object.

✻ And document is a special object
that we have access to in JavaScript.
And this object serves as an entry point into the DOM.

☑︎ document.querySelector('')
selects an element.


☑︎ document.querySelector()
mark selectors like we do in CSS
if you want to select a specific class
it will look lik that
☑︎ document.querySelector('.class')
if it is an id
☑︎ document.querySelector('#id').textContent
return the text that selector has if there is any
what if you want to set text for it?
☑︎ document.querySelector('#id').textContent = 'some text';

✻ So that means that the querySelector('') method
is available on the document object.
And so that's why we say that 'document'
is the entry point to the DOM,
because we need it to start selecting elements.
All right, then the first child element of document
is usually the HTML element, because that's usually
the root element in all HTML documents.

✻ But, now you might ask,
"If the DOM is not a part of the JavaScript language,
then how does this all work?"
Well, the DOM and DOM methods
are actually part of something called the 'Web APIs'.
So the web APIs are like libraries
that browsers implement
and that we can access from our JavaScript code.
And API stands for Application Programming Interface.

✻ A web APIs are, basically,
libraries that are also written in JavaScript
and that are automatically available for us to use.
So all this happens behind the scenes,
we don't have to import or do anything.
And there is actually an official DOM specification
that browsers implement,
which is the reason why DOM manipulation
works the same in all browsers.

✻ Now, besides the DOM,
there are actually a ton more web APIs,
such as timers, the fetch API, and many more.
